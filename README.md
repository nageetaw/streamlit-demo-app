## 🛠️ How to Run and Deploy

Follow these steps to set up, run, and deploy the app:

Find a model or an api that allow you to do your choice of task, Such as I did emotion classiciation using Hugging face model `j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base` through pipeline https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.por ipeline  

Now you can use streamlit to create a nice user interface quickly, if you want to have a seperate backend to create an API for inference you can use FastAPI, My goal was to try Streamlit only so I did inference in one file.

Push your code to github, connect streamlit with github and simply deploy your app, The user interface of streamit seems quite easy to use, and as it also provides a free account so you can use this to build your portfolio projects.
